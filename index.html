            <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                related to the project itself.</p>
